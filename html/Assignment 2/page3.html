        <h1>Semantic Elements</h1>
        <p>
            When building web pages, we use a Combination of non-semantic <strong>HTML</strong>
            and semantic <strong>HTML</strong>. The word semantic means <q><strong><em>relating to meaning</em></strong></q>,so <br>
            semantic elements provide information about the content between the <br>
            opening and closing tag.
        </p>
        <p>
            By using Semantic HTML, we select <strong>HTML</strong> elements based on their <br>
            meaning, not on how they are presented.Elements since they provide no context as to what is <br>
            inside those tags.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example,instead of using a &lt;div&gt; element to contain our header <br>
            information, we could use a &lt;header&gt; tag instead of a &lt;div&gt;,we provide context as to <br>
            what information is inside of the opening and closing tag.
        </p>
        <h2>Why use Semantic Elements?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Accessibilty:</strong>Semantic <strong>HTML</strong> makes webpages accessible for mobile <br>
                devices and for people with disabilities as well. This is because screen <br>
                readers and browsers are able to interpret the code better.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>SEO:</strong> It improves the website <strong>SEO</strong>,or <strong>Search Engine Optimization</strong>,which <br>
                is the process of increasing the number of people that visit your <br>
                webpage. With better <strong>SEO</strong>,search engines are better able to identify the <br>
                content of your website and weight the most important content <br>
                appropriately.
            </li>
            <li>
                <Strong>Easy to Understand:</Strong>Semantic <strong>HTML</strong> also makes tha website's source <br>
                coe easier to read for other web developers.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            to better understand this , you can think of compairing non-semantic <strong>HTML</strong><br>
            to going into a store with no signs on the aisles. Since the aisles aren't labeled,
            you don't know what products are in those in aisles.However, stores that do <br>
            have signs for each aisle make it a lot easier to find the items you need, just <br>
            like Semantic <strong>HTML</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many web sites contain <strong>HTML</strong> code like: <code>&lt;div id&equals;"header"&gt;,&lt;div <br>
            id&equals;"nav"&gt;,&lt;div id&equals;"main"&gt;&lt;div id&equals;"footer"&gt; to indicate <br>
            header ,navigation ,main content and footer.
        </code>
